For my personal project, I could create an app that can tell jokes when asked to. The user would ask a joke, he or she would say “tell me a joke”, and my app would respond by saying a joke, each joke being a different one. Another idea is that I can create a mini game like snake, where the user directs the snake to apples. The snake would periodically get longer as it eats more apples. The goal would be to get as long as possible without eating itself. This game might be hard to create since a lot of code would be put into the snake and the map itself. Although this game is a copy off the original, I’d hope to add music and funny creatures in the game to make it more interesting/fun. This app would pertain to children and kids instead of teens or adults. Another idea would be a rewards app. People would set goals for themselves and every time they checked in, they would verify that they completed that goal for the day and they would receive a reward. Rewards such as coupons to supermarkets or discounts to stores. This app would be compatible for both Apple and Android. Most likely Android.
