Comparison between Hashs and Arrays

Arrays are defined as something that orders integers and numbers. Negative numbers in an array indicate the last numbers in an Array. A Hash is a collection of key-value pairs. Similar to an Array, but instead of using an integer index, it uses object types. These objects must also be entered in corresponding order. In other words, an Array is an ordered list of things : a,b,c,d. A Hash is collection of pairs : {Max has a dog, Jacob has a ferrari}.
